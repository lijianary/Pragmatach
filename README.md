Pragmatach - A pragmatic MVC framework for Web Developers
==========

Pragmatach is a simple web framework aimed at providing rapid development of web applications using technologies which are familiar to developers developing real-world sites.  Pragmatach was developed to enable rapid development of sites by Javascript and CSS3 developers who need a supporting MVC framework, but don't wish to have to learn a new programming language such as Groovy or Scala, and who wish to have powerful features such built-in JSON support, Cache Control, and annotation driven request routing.
