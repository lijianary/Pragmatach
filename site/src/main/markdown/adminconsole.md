Administration Console
------------------------

Pragmatach has a built in web administration console, just browse to the context path

`/pragmatach/admin`

in your application.

On localhost, the link is:

`http://localhost:8080/<application context>/pragmatach/admin`

In order for your project to use the Admin plugin, it must include the "pragmatach-adminapp" maven dependency.
