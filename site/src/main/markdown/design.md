Pragmatach Design Principles
------------------------

Pragmatach was designed based on a number of core principles:

* Simplicity; creating server-side applications should be simple
* Modularity; Pragmatach features are all optional modules
* Broad support; Pragmatach supports a large number of J2EE containers, template engines, and relational persistence engines
* Adherance to standards; wherever possible Java standards have been leveraged, including Servlet, JMX, JAAS, and JNDI
