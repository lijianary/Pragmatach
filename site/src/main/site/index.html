			<h3>About Pragmatach</h3>

			<p>Pragmatach is a simple web framework aimed at providing rapid development of web applications using technologies which are familiar to developers developing real-world sites. Pragmatach was developed to enable rapid development of sites by Javascript and CSS3 developers who need a supporting MVC framework, but don't wish to have to learn a new programming language such as Groovy or Scala, and who wish to have powerful features such built-in JSON support, Cache Control, and annotation
				driven request routing.</p>

			<p>Features in Pragmatach include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Minimum client-side requirements; browser programmers should be free of restrictions</li>
				<li>Modular design allowing features such as i8n, Freemarker, JCR support, Websockets, Velocity, XStream and Gson to be configured via maven dependencies</li>
				<li>Java as the core programming languge, rather than Groovy or Scala</li>
				<li>A powerful admin console to enable fast easy debugging and operation of Pragmatach site</li>
				<li>JMX beans to allow monitoring and debugging of the site at runtime</li>
				<li>Grails-like routing via annotations</li>
				<li>Pluggable template processors; FreeMarker, Velocity and Thymeleaf supported</li>
				<li>Automatic JSON generation via Gson</li>
				<li>Built-in support for POSTing and GETing JSON from controllers</li>
				<li>Cache control headers specified via Annotations and generated automatically</li>
				<li>Support for Session and Request scoped controllers, via Annotations</li>
				<li>Automatic generation of project skeletons via a maven Archetype</li>
				<li>Projects built via maven, with Jetty and Tomcat6 and Tomcat7 profiles included</li>
				<li>Built-in support for i8n via plugins</li>
			</ul>
